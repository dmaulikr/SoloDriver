# SoloDriver

The Project aims at developing a sustainable handy solution for heavy vehicle drivers that can keep a track of driver’s location and an alarm system to provide them with regular alerts regarding environmental conditions and health benefits to help maintain the safety while they are on roads. A large number of people in Australia are into the profession of driving Trucks. Drivers have the responsibility to drive massive long vehicles for days together covering few thousands of kilometres. Hence, these drivers are more susceptible to incidents involving road rage, robbery, road accidents, falling asleep while driving, vehicle breakdown and health issues like back injuries, lack of rest and nutrition.
This application helps in addressing the above situation by maintaining a location tracker to track the driver’s real time location. It also has the feature of saving journey logs which will be used to display various alerts like nearby danger zones, road works at close proximity, changing weather conditions, animal crossing areas on highways. Alerts will assist the driver in choosing the appropriate path to help avoid accidents and be safe. Besides road safety, the reminder system will ring at regular intervals to remind the driver to take breaks, rest and eat. Its also going to reiterate the numbers of hours the driver should work to as per the government standard rules set by the Heavy Vehicle National Law and Regulations.
